                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information
                    is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a
                    purchase from covstrain.com (the “Site”).

                <h4>Personal information we collect</h4>
                <p>
                    When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain
                    information about your device, including information about
                    your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the
                    cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as
                    you browse the Site, we collect information about the
                    individual web pages or products that you view, what
                    websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and
                    information about how you interact with the Site. We refer
                    to this automatically-collected information as “Device
                    Information.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    We collect Device Information using the following
                    technologies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device
                        or computer and often include an anonymous unique
                        identifier. For more information about cookies, and how
                        to disable cookies, visit

                    <li>
                        “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and
                        collect data including your IP address, browser type,
                        Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and
                        date/time stamps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files
                        used to record information about how you browse the
                        Site.

                </ul>
                <p>
                    When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy
                    Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and
                    Order Information.

                <h4>How do we use your information?</h4>
                <p>
                    We use the Device Information that we collect to help us
                    screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP
                    address), and more generally to improve and optimize our
                    Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our
                    customers browse and interact with the Site).
                </p>
                <h4>Your rights</h4>
